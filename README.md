Hello guys

I'm a newbie here and i hope you guys help me to learn this programming. I don't do much now because of this pandemic so i start to do something that will help my time useful. I'm just a student and the course i've take is not related to information technology or programming therefore i don't have much knowledge on this but i really hope you guys support or at least guide me to learn this programming. Thank you! Keep safe everyone!
